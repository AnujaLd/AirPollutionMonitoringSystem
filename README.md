# Air pollution monitoring system

INTRODUCTION
❑ This project explains the depiction and execution of an Air Pollution detection system.
❑ Propose an air quality as well as air pollution monitoring system that allows us to monitor and check live air quality as well as air pollution in an area through Internet of Things (IoT).
❑ It uses air sensors to sense presence of harmful gases in the air and constantly transmit this data.
❑ Also, our system can clear polluted air.
